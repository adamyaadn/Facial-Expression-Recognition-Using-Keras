# Facial Expression recognition using Keras
This repository contains my work on Facial Expression Recognition as a part of my project during my Undergraduate Studies. The project mainly focuses on the use of the High-Level Framework, **Keras** and **HAAR Cascades** for facial recognition.  
In order to start the project, run the main.py file along with the necessary parameters. Data for training and Testing has also been given along with some examples.  
  
Cheers. :)
